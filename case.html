      <h3>Julie Evans</h3>
      <p>
        Julie lost 15 kilos and 54cm in 5 months and looks and feels amazing. But this isn’t a transformation story. Nor is it an advertisement for my services and what you too could achieve if you joined my team. In fact, past recognising Julie’s commitment, consistent effort and perseverance, I’m not a huge fan of transformation stories. Why?
        <ul>
           <li>Because one person’s transformation has absolutely nothing to do with another person.</li> 
           <li> Comparisons made on body size/shape alone are not only shallow, they only tell part of the story.</li>
           <li> One person’s goals and what’s driving them may be completely different to another persons.</li>
           <li> How someone went about achieving their goal may not work for someone else.</li>
           <li>Nutrition and exercise is part of a much bigger lifestyle picture and our ability to practice good nutrition and exercise can be dependent on many other things.</li> 
            Yes, Julie made some significant changes to her diet. She stopped drinking wine, cut out a lot of unnecessary sugars, included mainly             whole foods and lean sources of protein. She also exercised four to five times a week.
            </ul>
    What Julie ate and how she moved is just one part of the overall picture of life. She was highly motivated and in a position to fully     focus on herself and her goals. While we may love looking at people’s transformations and can use them as inspiration, be careful not to    pick-up what worked for someone else and think you can overlay it on your life with the same results.

    When contemplating dietary changes or a weightless goal, zoom out a little wider than the fridge. Consider your working hours, family     commitments, children, their ages, your sleep volume and quality, your stress levels or any underlying health conditions you have. Then     decide what level of sustainable change is possible. Consider also your goal and what it will really take to achieve it. Then decide if     you really want it. This is where some nutrition coaching may help. More often than not, my clients need permission to do less, not more.</p>

      <h3>Haley Bilston</h3>
      <p>
        For a girl who admits to needing a lot of encouragement to get out of her comfort zone, Haley Bilston now knows no other way to train. Haley joined the Gladstone training group in mid-2012 after a lot of encouragement from her good friend Robin. She has since revealed herself to be one of those natural athletes who just “get it”.<br>

Haley is an easy person to train. She grasps even the most technical movement patterns quickly and with a bit of practice is performing them like a pro. Whether its front squats, kettlebell cleans, boxing or double-unders, she quickly nails the technique which allows her to increase her load and her output.<br>

Strength and fitness however, didn’t happen overnight and like most new group training participants her first few sessions weren’t without the usual waves of nausea and delayed onset muscle soreness. She wasn’t deterred by this and with consistent persistence achieved fantastic results.<br>

“I can do things now that I never dreamed of a year ago and I’ve learnt so much,” she said. Haley was not overweight when she joined the group but has nevertheless managed to shed 5kg. And you can notice every bit of it.<br>

“I’ve lost around 5kg since I’ve been training with you but that’s not really why I joined your group training or why I enjoy it,” Haley said. “Yes, I’m happier with my body now but I’m even more happy with how I feel now. I’m the fittest, healthiest and strongest I’ve ever been and because of that I’m more confident and more resilient.”<br>

The results of all Haley’s hard work were evident at the Noosa Half Marathon in April where she ran a 1:53 at her first attempt. This is a fantastic result given a few hiccups with her preparation and in her race wrap-up she reported a max heart rate in excess of 185bpm and waves of dizziness and nausea as she pushed toward the finish line.<br>

Haley is thankful to Perfect Fit Training Solutions and Robin for encouraging her to join the fray. “I’m now so very glad she did,” she said. “Training is a great stress release as well and has changed my lifestyle for the better.”</p>

      <h3>Kerry Spice</h3>
      <p>
        Kerry has been in pretty good shape most of her life but came to Bec in July this year after a couple of injuries in 2010 left her unmotivated and struggling to get back on track.<br>

    Kerry weighed 68kg in July and her goal was to lose 5kg and to fit into her size 10 shorts by November this year.<br>

    This 36-year-old mother of two loves to train hard and pushes herself to new levels of effort every week in her personal training session.<br>

    She combines two strength-based training sessions per week with four runs and one other cardio class which she does at the gym.<br>

    Kerry has a more relaxed approach to diet these days after spending her 20s obsessed with food, counting calories and watching everything    she ate.
<br>
    She has achieved her results this time around through healthy, balanced eating and hard, consistent training.<br>

    She didn’t need to lose the 5kg to fit into the size 10 shorts. She lost just 3kg, gained muscle mass and achieved significant drops in     cms at her navel (8cms), waist (4cms), hips (6cms), thigh (3cms) and arms (2cms).<br>

    Her total body fat reduction was nine per cent.</p>

      <h3>Natalie Swann</h3>
      <p>
       I first met Nat nearly two years ago. She weighed over 130kg and had been inactive for a year after a bout of surgery and ill health. Since that time a lot has happened. She’s lost 16kg of body fat, 14cms off her waist, 14cms off her hips, 10cms off her thigh, 4cm off her arm and added a couple of kilograms of lean muscle to her frame. She also gave birth to her son Liam and continued to prioritise training with the demands of running her own business and motherhood.<br><br>

While Nat’s numbers tell an impressive tale, her physical and mental achievements prove there is much more to her story. Nat’s always been a large girl and before starting with Perfect Fit was never inclined towards playing sports or doing a lot of physical pursuits. However, this only served to keep hidden her natural abilities. Nat is blessed with good co-ordination and flexibility which help her pick up movements well and, as her strength improved, also allowed her to progress to more advanced variations. She also isn’t afraid to hurt and with a bit of encouragement, regularly pushes herself into the ‘red zone’.<br><br>

It’s a joy to watch someone getting the best out of themselves but it isn’t something you can teach. I’ve seen it time and time again. Some people are naturally inclined to hurt and find their limits, others aren’t. In saying that, there are a couple of movements she still hates and refuses to do like running and boxing but luckily she LOVES skipping and has recently mastered the double under, which is by no means an easy feat. She’s also great with a kettlebell and barbell and I’m always impressed with her depth and range of movement on exercises like lunges and squats. Nat considers herself a work in progress and would love to inspire other large ladies to get out and give things a go.</p>

      <h3>Glen Pengelly</h3>
      <p>
      When Glen walked into his first group training session in January 2014, he weighed 114kg and his exercise routine consisted of walking.<br>

That afternoon, he got through his first high intensity circuit workout with the help of exercise modifications but from that moment, was hooked.<br><br>

Glen now weighs 88kg and no longer walks but runs. He runs to supplement the 3-4 cross-training sessions he attends with Perfect Fit each week. With dedication, commitment and consistency, Glen has worked to master his exercise techniques and pushes himself to new levels with the support and encouragement of his training buddies.<br><br>

Having lost the weight, he is now looking forward to working on building more strength.<br><br>

Glen encouraged anyone of any size to make a change by making a start. “When I first came to Perfect Fit my weight-loss had plateaued and I decided I needed to mix things up as the walking was no longer enough,” Glen said.<br><br>

“I’ve achieved so much in the past year and really just enjoy the training. It’s a great stress reliever after work and regardless of what you achieve, there’s always new goals to set your sights on.
<br><br>
“You really don’t need to be fit to start, I definitely wasn’t, but you won’t realise how much more you’re capable of if you don’t start.”</p>
